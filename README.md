# **Retail Store Inventory Management System (CCT211 course project)**

## Python tkinter project in a nutshell (introduction)

* Inventory Management System (IMS) that replicates handheld devices at retail stores
* Graphic User Interface by Python's Tkinter Library
* Application will implement CRUD functionality to perform the following functionalities:
  1. View current inventory
  2. Add/Remove items
  3. Report missing items
* Employee Username and Password as required component for this IMS
* Uses other Python modules to analyze inventory data, sales graphs, profit & loss, and fiscal year reports

## Project goals

* Using fundamentals of Python's Tkinter library to handle CRUD operations
* Login system with formal authentication and authorization mechanisms for IMS security
* Uses Python's Pandas library to perform data analysis tasks
* Uses Python's Matplotlib library to visual data in graphs and charts

## Methodology

* Structured approach to achieve each defined goal:
  1. Conducting sufficient research on retail sector IMS that helps understand industry standards and user expectations.
  2. Design a user-friendly GUI with Python's Tkinter library to ensure interaction and navigation convenience.
  3. Iterative design, implementation, and testing cycles for functionality and reliability.
  4. Robust functions for CRUD operations to handle inventory manipulations.
  5. Secure login system with proper authentication mechanisms.
  6. Data analysis tasks with Pandas library.
  7. Data visualization with Matplotlib library.
